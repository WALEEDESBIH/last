For getting your inventory data ready properly before you add anyting to your DB, first you need to follow these steps:
1- Open python shell and run the following commands:
2- from inventory.models import Inventory, InventoryLocation
3- from e_commerce.utils import generate_locations_for_inventory
4- inventory = Inventory.objects.create(name='Warehouse A', rows_number=7, columns_number=7, layers_number=7)
5- generate_locations_for_inventory(inventory)

you're free to specify your actual inventory features (e.g. name, rows, columns, layers)

Good Luck :)
